     * The returned {@link Consumer#accept(Object)} method delegates directly to the {@link CheckedConsumer#accept(Object)} and catches any thrown checked {@link Exception}'s and rethrows them as a {@link CheckedExceptionRethrownException}<br>
     * Unless you provide a context-message (using {@link #safe(String, CheckedConsumer)} then any caught checked {@link Exception}'s message also becomes the {@link CheckedExceptionRethrownException}'s message.<br>
     * Any {@link RuntimeException}'s thrown aren't caught and the calling code will receive the original {@link RuntimeException} thrown.<br>
     * <br>
     * Usage example:<br>
     * Let's say we have a method called <code>someOperation</code> that cannot change, but which accepts a {@link Consumer} with the purpose of the calling the {@link Consumer#accept(Object)}.<br>
     * <pre>{@code

     * The problem will {@link Consumer#accept(Object)} occurs when {@link Consumer} calls any API that throws a checked {@link Exception}, e.g. the {@link java.io.File} API.<br>
     * Since {@link Consumer#accept(Object)} doesn't define that it throws any {@link Exception}'s we're forced to add a try/catch to handle the {@link java.io.IOException} for the code to compile:
