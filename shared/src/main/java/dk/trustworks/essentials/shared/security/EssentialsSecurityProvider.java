/**
 * Provides security-related services for validating roles and user access based on a principal.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines methods used to validate whether an authenticated user has the required roles,
 * mapped from client roles to "Essentials" roles. The roles are essential for performing security checks
 * on API methods to ensure that users have the proper access rights before performing certain operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The role validation process is fundamental in methods such as {@code validateSchedulerReaderRoles(Object principal)},
 * where the principal (authenticated user) is checked for specific roles required to perform certain actions.
 * Roles are mapped to Essentials roles defined in the {@link EssentialsSecurityRoles} enumeration.
 * For example, the role {@code SCHEDULER_READER} is used in access control checks to ensure that a user has
 * the appropriate role to interact with the scheduling-related resources.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #isAllowed(Object, String)} method checks if the provided principal has the required Essentials role.
 * If the role is missing, access is denied, and a {@link SecurityException} is thrown, ensuring that unauthorized
 * access is prevented.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Additionally, the {@link #getPrincipalName(Object)} method allows extracting the userâ€™s identification
 * from the principal, which is important for tracking and auditing user actions based on their roles.
 * </p>
