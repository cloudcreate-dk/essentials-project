 * Provides a {@link FencedLockManager} implementation using MongoDB and the SpringData MongoDB library to coordinate intra-service distributed locks<br>

 * To support customization of storage collection name, the {@code fencedLocksCollectionName} will be directly used as Collection name,

 * <br>
 * <strong>Security Note:</strong><br>
 * It is the responsibility of the user of this component to sanitize the {@code fencedLocksCollectionName}
 * to ensure the security of the resulting MongoDB configuration and associated Queries/Updates/etc. The {@link MongoFencedLockStorage} component, used by {@link MongoFencedLockManager} will
 * call the {@link MongoUtil#checkIsValidCollectionName(String)} method to validate the collection name as a first line of defense.<br>
 * The method provided is designed as an initial layer of defense against users providing unsafe collection names, by applying naming conventions intended to reduce the risk of malicious input.<br>
 * However, Essentials components as well as {@link MongoUtil#checkIsValidCollectionName(String)} does not offer exhaustive protection, nor does it assure the complete security of the resulting MongoDB configuration and associated Queries/Updates/etc..<br>
 * <b>The responsibility for implementing protective measures against malicious input lies exclusively with the users/developers using the Essentials components and its supporting classes.<br>
 * Users must ensure thorough sanitization and validation of API input parameters,  collection names.<br>
 * Insufficient attention to these practices may leave the application vulnerable to attacks, potentially endangering the security and integrity of the database.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is highly recommended that the {@code fencedLocksCollectionName} value is only derived from a controlled and trusted source.<br>
 * To mitigate the risk of malicious input attacks, external or untrusted inputs should never directly provide the {@code fencedLocksCollectionName} value.<br>
