/**
 * A primary concept of the EventStore is <b>Event Streams</b><br>
 * Definition: <b>An Event Stream is a collection of related Events.</b><br>
 * The most common denominator for Events in an Event Stream is the <b>Type of Aggregate</b> they're associated with.<br>
 *
 * <u><b>Security</b></u><br>
 * Depending on the chosen {@code PostgresqlEventStore} {@code AggregateEventStreamPersistenceStrategy}, e.g. {@code SeparateTablePerAggregateTypePersistenceStrategy},
 * then {@link AggregateType}'s value will be converted to a table name, or part of a table name, and thereafter directly be used in constructing SQL statements through string concatenation, which exposes that component to SQL injection attacks.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is the responsibility of the user of those components to sanitize the {@link AggregateType}'s value
 * to ensure the security of all the SQL statements generated by this component.<br>
 * <br>
 * Components may call the {@code PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} method to validate the table name as a first line of defense.<br>
 * The {@code PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} provides an initial layer of defense against SQL injection by applying naming conventions intended to reduce the risk of malicious input.<br>
 * However, Essentials components as well as {@code PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} does not offer exhaustive protection, nor does it assure the complete security of the resulting SQL against SQL injection threats.<br>
 * <b>The responsibility for implementing protective measures against SQL Injection lies exclusively with the users/developers using the Essentials components and its supporting classes.</b><br>
 * Users must ensure thorough sanitization and validation of API input parameters,  column, table, and index names.<br>
 * Insufficient attention to these practices may leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection, potentially endangering the security and integrity of the database.<br>
 *
 * <br>
 * It is highly recommended that the {@link AggregateType}'s value is only derived from a controlled and trusted source.<br>
 * To mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks, external or untrusted inputs should never directly provide the {@link AggregateType}'s value.<br>
 * <b>Failure to adequately sanitize and validate this value could expose the application to SQL injection
 *
 * <u>Aggregate examples:</u>
 * Classical examples of Aggregate Types and their associated events are:
 * <ul>
 *     <li><b>Order</b> aggregate<br>
 *     <i>Examples of Order Events:</i>
 *          <ul>
 *              <li>OrderCreated</li>
 *              <li>ProductAddedToOrder</li>
 *              <li>ProductRemoveFromOrder</li>
 *              <li>OrderAccepted</li>
 *          </ul>
 *      </li>
 *     <li><b>Account</b> aggregate<br>
 *     <i>Examples of Account Events:</i>
 *      <ul>
 *         <li>AccountRegistered</li>
 *         <li>AccountCredited</li>
 *         <li>AccountDebited</li>
 *      </ul>
 *     </li>
 *     <li><b>Customer</b> aggregate<br>
 *     <i>Examples of Customer Events:</i>
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>CustomerRegistered</li>
 *         <li>CustomerMoved</li>
 *         <li>CustomersAddressCorrected</li>
 *         <li>CustomerStatusChanged</li>
 *     </ul>
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * We could put all Events from all Aggregate Types into one Event Stream, but this is often <b>not very useful</b>:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>From a usage and use case perspective it makes more sense to subscribe and handle events related to the same type of Aggregates separate from
 *     the handling of other Events related to other types of Aggregates.<br>
 *     E.g. it makes more sense to handle Order related Events separate from Account related Events
 *     </li>
 *     <li>Using {@code SeparateTablePerAggregateTypePersistenceStrategy} we can store all Events related to a specific Aggregate Type in a separate table
 *     from other Aggregate types, which is more efficient and allows us to store many more Events related to this given {@link AggregateType}.<br>
 *     This allows use to use the globalEventOrdering to track the order in which Events, related to the same type of Aggregate, were persisted.<br>
 *     This also allows us to use the GlobalEventOrdering as a natual Resume-Point for EventStore subscriptions (see {@code EventStoreSubscriptionManager})
 *     </li>
 * </ul
 * <p>
 * This aligns with the concept of an AggregateEventStream, which contains Events related to a specific {@link AggregateType} with a distinct <b>AggregateId</b><br>
 * When loading/fetching and persisting/appending Events we always work at the Aggregate instance level, i.e., with AggregateEventStreams.<br>
 * <br>
 * The {@link AggregateType} is used for grouping/categorizing multiple AggregateEventStream instances related to similar types of aggregates.<br>
 * Unless you're using a fully functional style aggregate where you only perform a Left-Fold of all Events in an AggregateEventStream, then there will typically be a
 * 1-1 relationship between an {@link AggregateType} and the class that implements the Aggregate.<br>
 * <br>
 * What's important here is that the {@link AggregateType} is only a <b>name</b> and shouldn't be confused with the Fully Qualified Class Name of the Aggregate implementation class.<br>
 * This is the classical split between the logical concept and the physical implementation. It's important to not link the Aggregate Implementation Class (the Fully Qualified Class Name)
 * with the {@link AggregateType} name as that would make refactoring of your code base much harder, as the Fully Qualified Class Name then would be captured in the stored Events.<br>
 * Had the {@link AggregateType} and the Aggregate Implementation Class been one and the same, then moving the Aggregate class to another package or renaming it would break many things.<br>
 * To avoid the temptation to use the same name for both the {@link AggregateType} and the Aggregate Implementation Class, we prefer using the <b>plural name</b> of the Aggregate as the {@link AggregateType} name.<br>
 * Example:
 * <table>
 *     <tr><td>Aggregate-Type</td><td>Aggregate Implementation Class (Fully Qualified Class Name)</td><td>Top-level Event Type (Fully Qualified Class Name)</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>Orders</td><td>com.mycompany.project.persistence.Order</td><td>com.mycompany.project.persistence.OrderEvent</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>Accounts</td><td>com.mycompany.project.persistence.Account</td><td>com.mycompany.project.persistence.AccountEvent</td></tr>
 *     <tr><td>Customer</td><td>com.mycompany.project.persistence.Customer</td><td>com.mycompany.project.persistence.CustomerEvent</td></tr>
 * </table>
