/**
 * A stateful {@link Aggregate} is the most common form of Aggregate design in Object Oriented languages.<br>
 * What makes an {@link Aggregate} stateful is the fact that any changes, i.e. Events applied as the result of calling command methods on the aggregate instance, are stored
 * within the {@link StatefulAggregate} prior to persisting the aggregate, and the events associated with any changes can be queried using {@link #getUncommittedChanges()} and is
 * reset (e.g. after a transaction/{@link UnitOfWork} has completed) using {@link #markChangesAsCommitted()}<br>
 * <br>
 * See {@link FlexAggregate} for an immutable {@link Aggregate} design
 *
 * @param <ID>             the type of id
 * @param <EVENT_TYPE>     the type of event
