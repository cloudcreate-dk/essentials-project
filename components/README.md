# Essentials Java Components

Essentials Components is a set of Java version 17 (and later) components that are based on
the [Essentials](../README.md) library while providing more complex features
or Components such as `EventStore`, `EventSourced Aggregates`, `FencedLocks`, `DurableQueues`, `DurableLocalCommandbus`, `Inbox` and `Outbox`.

> Note: [For Java version 11 to 16 support, please use version 0.9.*](https://github.com/cloudcreate-dk/essentials-project/tree/java11)

# Event Sourced Aggregates

This library focuses on providing different flavours of Event Source Aggregates that are built to work with
the `EventStore` concept.  
The `EventStore` is very flexible and doesn't specify any specific design requirements for an Aggregate or its Events,
except that that have to be associated with an `AggregateType` (see the
`AggregateType` sub section or the `EventStore` section for more information).

This library supports multiple flavours of Aggregate design such as:

- The **modern** `dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components.eventsourced.aggregates.stateful.modern.AggregateRoot`
- The *classic* `dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components.eventsourced.aggregates.stateful.classic.AggregateRoot`
- The *classic* with separate state
  object `dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components.eventsourced.aggregates.stateful.classic.state.AggregateRootWithState`
- The **functional** `dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components.eventsourced.aggregates.flex.FlexAggregate`

The **modern** `AggregateRoot`, *classic* `AggregateRoot` and *classic* `AggregateRootWithState` are all examples of a
mutable `StatefulAggregate` design.

What makes an `Aggregate` design **stateful** is the fact that any changes, i.e. Events applied as the result of calling
command methods on the aggregate instance, are stored within
the `StatefulAggregate` and can be queried using `getUncommittedChanges()` and reset (e.g. after a
transaction/UnitOfWork has completed) using `markChangesAsCommitted()`

Each aggregate loaded or being saved gets associated with the currently active `UnitOfWork`.  
When the `UnitOfWork` is in the commit phase, then the `UnitOfWork` is queries for all changed entities, and the events
stored within the `StatefulAggregate`'s
will be persisted to the `EventStore`.

The `FlexAggregate` follows a functional immutable Aggregate design where each command method returns
the `EventsToPersist` and applying events doesn't alter the state of the aggregate (only rehydration modifies the
aggregate state).

To use `EventSourced Aggregates` just add the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components/groupId>
    <artifactId>eventsourced-aggregates</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.2</version>
</dependency>
```

See [eventsourced-aggregates](eventsourced-aggregates/README.md)

# PostgreSQL Event Store

This library contains a fully featured Event Store that supports persisting Aggregate event streams
into Postgresql.

The primary concept of the EventStore are **Event Streams**   
Definition: An Event Stream is a collection of related Events *(e.g. Order events that are related to Order aggregate
instances)*

It supports the [eventsourced-aggregates](eventsourced-aggregates/README.md) module as well as
advanced concepts such an `EventStoreSubscriptionManager` which supports durable subscriptions, where
the `EventStoreSubscriptionManager` keeps track of the individual subscribers `ResumePoint`'s (similar to
how Kafka keeps track of Consumers Topic offsets).

This library also provides an `EventProcessor` concept, which is an Event Modeling style Event Sourced Event Processor Event and Command message Handler.

To use `Postgresql Event Store` just add the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql-event-store</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.2</version>
</dependency>
```

See [postgresql-event-store](postgresql-event-store/README.md)

# Spring PostgreSQL Event Store

This library provides the `SpringTransactionAwareEventStoreUnitOfWorkFactory` (as opposed to the
standard `EventStoreManagedUnitOfWorkFactory`)
which allows the `EventStore` to participate in Spring managed Transactions.

```
@SpringBootApplication
class Application {
    @Bean
    public com.fasterxml.jackson.databind.Module essentialJacksonModule() {
        return new EssentialTypesJacksonModule();
    }

    @Bean
    public Jdbi jdbi(DataSource dataSource) {
        Jdbi jdbi = Jdbi.create(new TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy(dataSource));
        return jdbi;
    }
    
    @Bean
    public EventStoreUnitOfWorkFactory unitOfWorkFactory(Jdbi jdbi, PlatformTransactionManager transactionManager) {
        return new SpringTransactionAwareEventStoreUnitOfWorkFactory(jdbi, transactionManager);
    }
}
```

With the `SpringTransactionAwareEventStoreUnitOfWorkFactory` you can either use the `UnitOfWorkFactory` to start and commit Spring transactions, or you can use
the `TransactionTemplate` class or `@Transactional` annotation to start and commit transactions.

No matter how a transaction is started, you can always acquire the active `UnitOfWork` using

```
unitOfWorkFactory.getCurrentUnitOfWork()
```

To use `Spring Postgresql Event Store` just add the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-postgresql-event-store</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.2</version>
</dependency>
```

See [spring-postgresql-event-store](spring-postgresql-event-store/README.md)

# Distributed Fenced Lock

This library provides a Distributed Locking Manager based of the Fenced Locking concept
described [here](https://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html)  
and comes in two different flavours: `MongoFencedLockManager` and `PostgresqlFencedLockManager`  

The `FencedLockManager` is responsible for obtaining distributed `FencedLock`'s, which are named exclusive locks.  
Only one `FencedLockManager` instance can acquire a `FencedLock` at a time.
The implementation has been on supporting **intra-service** (i.e. across different deployed instances of the **same** service) Lock support through database based implementations (`MongoFencedLockManager` and `PostgresqlFencedLockManager`).  
In a service oriented architecture it's common for all deployed instances of a given service (e.g. a Sales service) to share the same underlying
database(s). As long as the different deployed (Sales) services instances can share the same underlying database, then you use the `FencedLockManager` concept for handling distributed locks across all deployed (Sales service)
instances in the cluster.  
If you need cross-service lock support, e.g. across instances of different services (such as across Sales, Billing and Shipping services), then you need to use a dedicated distributed locking service such as Zookeeper.

See [foundation](foundation/README.md) for more information about how to use the `FencedLockManager`

## PostgresqlFencedLockManager

Provides a `FencedLockManager` implementation using Postgresql to coordinate intra-service distributed locks 

Configuration example:

```
var lockManager = PostgresqlFencedLockManager.builder()
                                      .setJdbi(Jdbi.create(jdbcUrl,
                                                           username,
                                                           password))
                                      .setUnitOfWorkFactory(unitOfWorkFactory)
                                      .setLockTimeOut(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
                                      .setLockConfirmationInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1))
                                      .buildAndStart(); 
```                                                

To use `PostgreSQL Distributed Fenced Lock` just add the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql-distributed-fenced-lock</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.2</version>
</dependency>
```

See [foundation](foundation/README.md) for more information about how to use the `FencedLockManager`  
See [postgresql-distributed-fenced-lock](postgresql-distributed-fenced-lock/README.md) for more information about how to use the `PostgresqlFencedLockManager`

## MongoFencedLockManager

Provides a `FencedLockManager` implementation using MongoDB and the SpringData MongoDB library to coordinate intra-service distributed locks

```
    public MongoFencedLockManager(MongoTemplate mongoTemplate,
                                  MongoConverter mongoConverter,
                                  UnitOfWorkFactory<? extends ClientSessionAwareUnitOfWork> unitOfWorkFactory,
                                  Optional<String> lockManagerInstanceId,
                                  Optional<String> fencedLocksCollectionName,
                                  Duration lockTimeOut,
                                  Duration lockConfirmationInterval) {
      ...
    }
```

Usage example:

```
@Bean
public FencedLockManager fencedLockManager(MongoTemplate mongoTemplate,
                                           MongoConverter mongoConverter,
                                           MongoTransactionManager transactionManager,
                                           MongoDatabaseFactory databaseFactory) {
  return MongoFencedLockManager.builder()
                               .setMongoTemplate(mongoTemplate)
                               .setMongoConverter(mongoConverter)
                               .setUnitOfWorkFactory(new SpringMongoTransactionAwareUnitOfWorkFactory(transactionManager,
                                                                                                      databaseFactory))
                               .setLockTimeOut(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
                               .setLockConfirmationInterval(Duration.ofSeconds(1)))
                               .buildAndStart();

## Durable Queue

The `DurableQueues` concept supports intra-service point-to-point messaging using durable Queues that guarantee At-Least-Once delivery of messages. The only requirement is that message producers and message consumers can access
the same underlying durable Queue storage.

This library focuses on providing a Durable Queue supporting message redelivery and Dead Letter Message functionality
and comes in two flavours `PostgresqlDurableQueues` and `MongoDurableQueues` which both implement the `DurableQueues` interface.

In a service oriented architecture it's common for all deployed instances of a given service (e.g. a Sales service) to share the same underlying
database(s). As long as the different deployed (Sales) services instances can share the same underlying database, then you use the `DurableQueues` concept for point-to-point messaging across all deployed (Sales service)
instances in the cluster.  
If you need cross-service point-to-point messaging support, e.g. across instances of different services (such as across Sales, Billing and Shipping services), then you need to use a dedicated distributed Queueing service such as RabbitMQ.

Each Queue is uniquely identified by its `QueueName`.
Durable Queue concept that supports **queuing** a message on to a Queue. Each message is associated with a
unique `QueueEntryId`.

See [foundation](foundation/README.md) for more information about how to use the `DurableQueues`

## PostgresqlDurableQueues

To use `PostgreSQL Durable Queue` just add the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>postgresql-queue</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Example setting up `PostgresqlDurableQueues` (note: you can also use it together with either
the `EventStoreManagedUnitOfWorkFactory` or `SpringManagedUnitOfWorkFactory`):

```
var unitOfWorkFactory = new JdbiUnitOfWorkFactory(jdbi);
var durableQueues = new PostgresqlDurableQueues(unitOfWorkFactory);
durableQueues.start();
```

See [foundation](foundation/README.md) for more information about how to use `PostgresqlDurableQueues` and `DurableQueues`

## MongoDurableQueues

To use `MongoDB Durable Queue` just add the following Maven dependency:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>dk.cloudcreate.essentials.components</groupId>
    <artifactId>springdata-mongo-queue</artifactId>
    <version>0.30.2</version>
</dependency>
```

Example setting up `MongoDurableQueues`:

```
    @Bean
    public SingleValueTypeRandomIdGenerator registerIdGenerator() {
        return new SingleValueTypeRandomIdGenerator();
    }

    @Bean
    public MongoCustomConversions mongoCustomConversions() {
        return new MongoCustomConversions(List.of(
                new SingleValueTypeConverter(QueueEntryId.class,
                                             QueueName.class)));
    }

    @Bean
    public MongoTransactionManager transactionManager(MongoDatabaseFactory databaseFactory) {
        return new MongoTransactionManager(databaseFactory);
    }


    @Bean
    MongoTemplate mongoTemplate(MongoDatabaseFactory mongoDbFactory, MongoConverter converter) {
        MongoTemplate mongoTemplate = new MongoTemplate(mongoDbFactory, converter);
        mongoTemplate.setWriteConcern(WriteConcern.ACKNOWLEDGED);
        mongoTemplate.setWriteResultChecking(WriteResultChecking.EXCEPTION);
        return mongoTemplate;
    }
```
