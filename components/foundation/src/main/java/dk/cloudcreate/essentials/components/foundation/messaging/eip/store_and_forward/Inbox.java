/**
 * The {@link Inbox} supports the transactional Store and Forward pattern from Enterprise Integration Patterns supporting At-Least-Once delivery guarantee.<br>
 * The {@link Inbox} pattern is used to handle incoming messages from a message infrastructure (such as a Queue, Kafka, EventBus, etc). <br>
 * The message is added to the {@link Inbox} in a transaction/{@link UnitOfWork} and afterwards the message is Acknowledged (ACK) with the message infrastructure the {@link UnitOfWork} is committed.<br>
 * If the ACK fails then the message infrastructure will attempt to redeliver the message even if the {@link UnitOfWork} has been committed, since the message infrastructure and the {@link Inbox}
 * don't share the same transactional resource. This means that messages received from the message infrastructure
 * can be added more than once to the {@link Inbox}.<br>
 * After the {@link UnitOfWork} has been committed, the messages will be asynchronously delivered to the message consumer in a new {@link UnitOfWork}.<br>
 * The {@link Inbox} itself supports Message Redelivery in case the Message consumer experiences failures.<br>
 * This means that the Message consumer, registered with the {@link Inbox}, can and will receive Messages more than once and therefore its message handling has to be idempotent.
 * <p>
 * If you're working with {@link OrderedMessage}'s then the {@link Inbox} consumer must be configured
 * with {@link InboxConfig#getMessageConsumptionMode()} having value {@link MessageConsumptionMode#SingleGlobalConsumer}
 * in order to be able to guarantee that {@link OrderedMessage}'s are delivered in {@link OrderedMessage#getOrder()} per {@link OrderedMessage#getKey()}
 * across as many {@link InboxConfig#numberOfParallelMessageConsumers} as you wish to use.
