/**

 * var msgUnderDelivery = durableQueues.getNextMessageReadyForDelivery(queueName);
 * if (msgUnderDelivery.isPresent()) {
 *    try {

 * When using {@link TransactionalMode#SingleOperationTransaction} then depending on
 * the type of errors that can occur this MAY leave a dequeued message in a state of being marked as "being delivered" forever<br>
 * This is why {@link DurableQueues} supporting these modes must ensure that they periodically
 * discover messages that have been under delivery for a long time (aka. stuck messages or timed-out messages) and reset them in order for them to be redelivered.<br>

public enum TransactionalMode {
    /**
     * When using this mode all the queueing, de-queueing methods requires an existing {@link UnitOfWork}
     * started prior to being called. The reason for this is that Queues are typically used together with the {@link Inbox}
     * {@link Outbox} pattern, which benefits from including queueing/de-queueing together with other database entity modifying operations.<br>
     * When changing an entity and queueing/de-queueing happens in ONE shared transaction (NOTE this requires that the entity storage and the queue storage
     * to use the same database - e.g. Postgresql or MongoDB) then the shared database transaction guarantees that all the data storage operations
     * are committed or rollback as one<br>
     * The disadvantage of this is that any explicit {@link UnitOfWork#markAsRollbackOnly()}/{@link UnitOfWork#markAsRollbackOnly(Exception)}, either directly our through e.g. {@link UnitOfWorkControllingCommandBusInterceptor},
     * will cause the message handling to rollback and the message will retry indefinitely without any delay (i.e. the {@link RedeliveryPolicy} is ignored because message handling is rolledback)

     * Useful for long-running message handling, you can choose to configure the {@link DurableQueues} to only require single operation
     * (such as {@link DurableQueues#getNextMessageReadyForDelivery(GetNextMessageReadyForDelivery)} , {@link DurableQueues#deleteMessage(DeleteMessage)} , etc.)
     * as well as for certain NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB/DocumentDB, that have limitations when performing multiple data storage operations within a transaction.<br>
     * For these cases you can configure the {@link TransactionalMode} as {@link #SingleOperationTransaction} where queueing and de-queueing are performed using separate (single document)
