/**
 * A Decider (aka a command or use-case handler) is a class with a single [handle] method,
 * that can handle a specific concrete [COMMAND] and based on its logic it will decide
 * if **zero** or **one** [EVENT] is returned;
 * or in case it's unable to handle the Command (e.g. due to invariant rules) an Exception is thrown.
 *
 * Command handling SHOULD be **idempotent**, meaning that if a Command has already been handled then
 * the [handle] method MUST return **zero** Events as opposed to throwing an Exception.
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * class ShipOrderDecider : Decider<ShipOrder, OrderEvent> {
 *     override fun handle(cmd: ShipOrder, events: List<OrderEvent>): OrderEvent? {
 *         if (events.isEmpty()) {
 *             throw RuntimeException("Cannot accept an order that hasn't been created")
 *         }
 *         if (events.any { it is OrderShipped}) {
 *             // Already shipped - idempotent handling
 *             return null
 *         }
 *         if (!events.any { it is OrderAccepted }) {
 *             throw RuntimeException("Cannot ship an order that hasn't been accepted")
 *         }
 *         return OrderShipped(cmd.id)
 *     }
 *
 *     override fun canHandle(cmd: Any): Boolean {
 *        return cmd is ShipOrder
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
