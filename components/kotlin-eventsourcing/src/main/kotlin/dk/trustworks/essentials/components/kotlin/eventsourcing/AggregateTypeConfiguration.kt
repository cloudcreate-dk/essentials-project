/**
 * [AggregateType] configuration which defines how the [dk.trustworks.essentials.components.eventsourced.eventstore.postgresql.ConfigurableEventStore]
 * should be configured in order to support event-streams for the specified [aggregateType]
 *
 * If you register your [AggregateTypeConfiguration] in Spring as a **Bean** and combine it with [DeciderSupportsAggregateTypeChecker] then
 * [AggregateType]'s are automatically registered with the [dk.trustworks.essentials.components.eventsourced.eventstore.postgresql.EventStore]
 *
 * Example:
 * ```
 * @Configuration
 * class OrdersConfiguration {
 *     companion object {
 *         @JvmStatic
 *         val AGGREGATE_TYPE = AggregateType.of("Orders")
 *     }
 *
 *     @Bean
 *     fun orderAggregateTypeConfiguration(): AggregateTypeConfiguration {
 *         return AggregateTypeConfiguration(AGGREGATE_TYPE,
 *             OrderId::class.java,
 *             AggregateIdSerializer.serializerFor(OrderId::class.java),
 *             DeciderSupportsAggregateTypeChecker.HandlesCommandsThatInheritsFromCommandType(OrderCommand::class),
 *             commandAggregateIdResolver = { cmd -> (cmd as OrderCommand).id },
 *             eventAggregateIdResolver = { e -> (e as OrderEvent).id })
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @param aggregateType The [AggregateType] that is being configured
 * @param aggregateIdType The **Aggregate-Id** type that is used in commands and events relating to the [AggregateType]
 * @param aggregateIdSerializer The [AggregateIdSerializer] capable of serializing/deserializing the **AggregateType-Id**
 * @param deciderSupportsAggregateTypeChecker  A [DeciderSupportsAggregateTypeChecker] instance which given a concrete [Decider] instance is capable of determining
 * if the given [Decider] instance is working with the [AggregateType] configured in this [AggregateTypeConfiguration] - see [DeciderSupportsAggregateTypeChecker.HandlesCommandsThatInheritsFromCommandType]
 * @param commandAggregateIdResolver - A [CommandAggregateIdResolver] which can resolve the optional Aggregate-Id value from an instance of a Command compatible with this [AggregateType]
 * @param eventAggregateIdResolver - A [EventAggregateIdResolver] which can resolve the required Aggregate-Id value from an instance of an Event compatible with this [AggregateType]
