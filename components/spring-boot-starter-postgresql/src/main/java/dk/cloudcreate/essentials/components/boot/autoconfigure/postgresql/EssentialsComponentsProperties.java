 * <u>{@link PostgresqlFencedLockManager}</u><br>
 * To support customization of {@link PostgresqlFencedLockManager} storage table name, the {@link EssentialsComponentsProperties#getFencedLockManager()}'s {@link FencedLockManagerProperties#setFencedLocksTableName(String)}
 * will be directly used in constructing SQL statements through string concatenation, which exposes the component to SQL injection attacks.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is the responsibility of the user of this component to sanitize the {@code fencedLocksTableName}
 * to ensure the security of all the SQL statements generated by this component. The {@link PostgresqlFencedLockStorage} component will
 * call the {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} method to validate the table name as a first line of defense.<br>
 * However, Essentials components as well as {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} does not offer exhaustive protection, nor does it assure the complete security of the resulting SQL against SQL injection threats.<br>
 * <b>The responsibility for implementing protective measures against SQL Injection lies exclusively with the users/developers using the Essentials components and its supporting classes.</b><br>
 * Users must ensure thorough sanitization and validation of API input parameters,  column, table, and index names.<br>
 * Insufficient attention to these practices may leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection, potentially endangering the security and integrity of the database.<br>
 * <br>
 * It is highly recommended that the {@code fencedLocksTableName} value is only derived from a controlled and trusted source.<br>
 * To mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks, external or untrusted inputs should never directly provide the {@code fencedLocksTableName} value.<br>
 * <b>Failure to adequately sanitize and validate this value could expose the application to SQL injection
 * vulnerabilities, compromising the security and integrity of the database.</b><br>

 * <u>{@link PostgresqlDurableQueues}</u><br>
 * To support customization of {@link PostgresqlDurableQueues} storage table name, the {@link EssentialsComponentsProperties#getDurableQueues()}'s {@link DurableQueuesProperties#setSharedQueueTableName(String)}
 * will be directly used in constructing SQL statements through string concatenation, which exposes the component to SQL injection attacks.<br>
 * It is the responsibility of the user of this component to sanitize the {@code sharedQueueTableName}
 * to ensure the security of all the SQL statements generated by this component. The {@link PostgresqlDurableQueues} component will
 * call the {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} method to validate the table name as a first line of defense.<br>
 * The {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} provides an initial layer of defense against SQL injection by applying naming conventions intended to reduce the risk of malicious input.<br>

         *                             to ensure the security of all the SQL statements generated by this component. The {@link PostgresqlFencedLockStorage} component will
         *                             call the {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} method to validate the table name as a first line of defense.<br>
         *                             The {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} provides an initial layer of defense against SQL injection by applying naming conventions intended to reduce the risk of malicious input.<br>
         *                             However, {@link PostgresqlUtil#checkIsValidTableOrColumnName(String)} does not offer exhaustive protection, nor does it assure the complete security of the resulting SQL against SQL injection threats.<br>
         *                             <b>The responsibility for implementing protective measures against SQL Injection lies exclusively with the users/developers using the Essentials components and its supporting classes.</b><br>
         *                             Users must ensure thorough sanitization and validation of API input parameters,  column, table, and index names.<br>
         *                             Insufficient attention to these practices may leave the application vulnerable to SQL injection, potentially endangering the security and integrity of the database.<br>
         *                             <br>
         *                             It is highly recommended that the {@code fencedLocksTableName} value is only derived from a controlled and trusted source.<br>
         *                             To mitigate the risk of SQL injection attacks, external or untrusted inputs should never directly provide the {@code fencedLocksTableName} value.<br>
         *                             <b>Failure to adequately sanitize and validate this value could expose the application to SQL injection
